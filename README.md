# Workshop: ASP.NET Core

### Workshop to understand and build an ASP.NET Core app from scratch, using the dotnet CLI and VS Code.

Start with [00-BasicAspNetCoreApp](https://github.com/Wyntuition/aspnetcore-workshop-kit/tree/master/00-BasicAspNetCoreApp), and follow the instructions. You don't need to clone the 'start' project - the first step is from scratch and the next steps build on each other, but you can clone in subsequent steps if you don't make it that far. The 'end' folders have the completed application for that section.
