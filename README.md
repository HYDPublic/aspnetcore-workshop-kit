# Workshop: ASP.NET Core

### Workshop to understand and build an ASP.NET Core app from scratch, using the dotnet CLI and VS Code.

Start with 00. There are code snippits used in each section in the respective numbered folders, in 'start'. The 'end' folders have the completed application for that section. Step-by-step instructions are not currently included, so you will have to know how to go thru it, talk someone thru it, or follow this as a good reference, https://github.com/DamianEdwards/aspnetcore-workshop.
